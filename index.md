As we can see the production of meat and dairy releases many times more greenhouse gas emissions than the production of nuts and vegetables. This is caused by the cost of land from raising these animals to produce these meats and dairy. Factory farms are the largest users of land resources globally, and roughly 80% of the agricultural land use is used to grow crops to feed these farm animals. 60% of this land used to feed farm animals goes into beef production however beef is only about 2% of calories consumed worldwide. On top of this roughly 10% of waterflow worldwide is put towards feeding livestock. Lastly, the waste produced by livestock is one of the biggest contributers of releasing methane gas into the environment which is a greenhouse gas 86 times more of a potent than CO2.
